## How to Use

To run this CPAP Extractor, open up the containing

The CPAP Extractor takes the name of a binary file
as an argument, so if you wanted to extract the data
from a binary file called 000008ac.001, you would run the command:
cpap_extraction.py 000008ac.001

The program will produce a CSV file in the specified directory.

The program comes with a configuration file. You can specify
what type of data you would like to extract from the binary
out of the 24 different data types.
